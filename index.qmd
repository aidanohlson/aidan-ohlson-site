#### About Me

I am a statistician and data scientist with a strong foundation in analytical 
methods, statistical modeling, and machine learning. My work focuses on the 
intersection of data science, predictive modeling, and real-world applications 
across tech, strategy, and decision-making. I am especially interested in 
how these approaches can inform complex systems and create practical impact.

I recently completed my undergraduate studies in Statistics and Data Science at
the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where I developed expertise 
in statistical inference, computational models, and data engineering. During 
my time at UCLA, I worked on a range of applied projects, and gained hands-on 
experience with tools and techniques at the heart of modern data science.

I am seeking opportunities to apply my skills in diverse and impactful settings
— from machine learning research and data product development, to roles in tech 
or policy forecasting. I remain broadly open to domains where rigor, curiosity, 
and data-driven thinking can make a difference.


#### Personal Life

I was born and raised in Anchorage, Alaska, where I spent much of my time 
outdoors. I grew up downhill skiing in the winters and I spent my weekends fly 
fishing for rainbow trout, backpacking in the Chugach Mountains, and camping 
across Southcentral Alaska.

I later moved to Los Angeles to attend UCLA, where I picked up golfing (or tried to) 
and beach volleyball. Living with my good friends in the city taught me that 
good company will always hold importance over anything else.

These days, I still spend most of my free time outside — golfing, hiking, and 
chasing trout with a fly rod whenever I get the chance.
